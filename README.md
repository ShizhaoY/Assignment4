# Assignment4
## Motivation

â€‹	In this assignment, you will write a multi-threaded program that implements the banker's algorithm.  

Customers request and release resources from the bank. The banker will keep track of the resources. The  

banker will grant a request if it satisfies the safety algorithm. If a request does not leave the system in a  

safe state, the banker will deny it.

## Installation

gcc 180583280_173046900_a04.c  -o 180583280_173046900_a04
